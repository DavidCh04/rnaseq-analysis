# RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
This proyect implements an RNA- seq analysis workflow using publicly available data.
The aim is to identify differentially expressed genes between experimental conditions.

## Dataset
The RNA-seq data was obtained from a public GEO dataset. (Exact accession number to be added.)

## Workflow
1. Quality control of raw reads.
2. Read alignment / quantification.
3. Gene-level expression analysis.
4. Differential expression analysis.
5. Visualization of results.

## Tools
- Bash
- Python
- R
- Snakemake (¿?)

## Status
Work in progress
